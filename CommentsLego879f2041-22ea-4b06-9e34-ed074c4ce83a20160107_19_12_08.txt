Your Train Station looks very Grande Indeed and is truly a Beautiful Train Station, and it\u0027s amazingly Detailed with true to life features!. I\u0027ve just supported your Project (supporter #4328) and I\u0027m hoping other people will board the Support Train as well so you can reach your 10k Goal!. I would love to see this as a Creator or Modular Set and would probably be a Great Seller, and if given the opportunity I would buy 1 too.

Big enough to be truly impressive, small enough to easily slot into the modular line of buildings and not have too many pieces to be uneconomical for Lego to mass produce. Every time I look at it I\u0027m impressed with how well it uses the space of a regular modular to pack in so much detail. \nI hope it doesn\u0027t come to it, but sell the instructions please if Lego Ideas don\u0027t go with it, but they\u0027d be fools not to. 10,000 supporters can\u0027t come soon enough.","user_vote":"2"},{"id":"49ff6be5-c46c-44c0-bb11-dffb38975a8c","author":"Seals21","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1445671436","comment":"Amazing love the details and it would be a great edition to my seal city. supported and hope to see in shops soon","user_vote":"2"},{"id":"a5e68c3a-68f2-47cc-bbe2-3f185fd5ab7c","author":"RothausNoppe","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1445711498","comment":"Great work - good luck for 10,000!\nWould love to buy it","user_vote":"2"},{"id":"490fc2bd-df09-445b-9df7-df9582384568","author":"Girlybug101","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1445734260","comment":"You\u0027ve done an amazing job with the detail of the bricks!","user_vote":"3"},{"id":"81564ff7-22f5-4a66-ae71-0652ce71ea8c","author":"McFaren","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1445826453","comment":"A beauty.
